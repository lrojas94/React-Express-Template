###Before trying anything do:###

npm install -g nodemon webpack concurrently

Why?:
-Nodemon is used to track server-side changes.
-Webpack is used to build application using REACT and track front-end changes.
-Concurrently is to run Nodemon and Webpack together so that you can track changes on both, front-end and back-end

### To run: ###

npm install
npm start

### BASIC FLOW ###

->Express renders index.html with NO DATA FROM THE SERVER.
->The app can use AJAX to request something from the server API
->Within itself, the app uses routes in order to handle different components and such.
